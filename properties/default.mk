# Enable app/sf phase offset as durations. The numbers below are translated from the existing
# positive offsets by finding the duration app/sf will have with the offsets.
# For SF the previous value was 6ms which under 16.6ms vsync time (60Hz) will leave SF with ~10.5ms
# for each frame. For App the previous value was 2ms which under 16.6ms vsync time will leave the
# App with ~20.5ms (16.6ms * 2 - 10.5ms - 2ms). The other values were calculated similarly.
# Full comparison between the old vs. the new values are captured in
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a_5cVNY3LUAkeg-yL56rYQNwved6Hy-dvEcKSxp6f8k/edit
